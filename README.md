## 📁 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to host a static website on AWS S3. It includes a working HTML file, a hosting guide, and supporting resources. The site was successfully deployed using the AWS Free Tier, and screenshots are preserved in the included PDF. The S3 bucket has now been deleted to avoid additional charges.

## 📄 Files Included

- `index.html`: Homepage for the static website
- `legendary-aws-host-a-website-on-s3.pdf`: Step-by-step guide with screenshots of the hosted site
- `NextWork-Everyone should be in a job they love_files.zip`: Career-related resources and supporting materials

## 🚀 How to Use

You can replicate the hosting process by following the PDF guide. The `index.html` file can also be hosted using GitHub Pages for free.



## 🧹 Note

The original AWS S3 bucket used for hosting has been deleted to avoid charges beyond the Free Tier. All documentation and resources remain available in this repository.
