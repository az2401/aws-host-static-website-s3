# aws-host-static-website-s3
This project demonstrates how to host a static website on AWS S3. I uploaded an `index.html` file and assets, enabled static website hosting, configured ACLs, and resolved a 403 error. It taught me key cloud concepts like bucket endpoints, access control, and public permissions.
